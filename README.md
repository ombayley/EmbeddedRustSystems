# 📘 Bare Metal Rasberry Pi

> Implement bare-metal (no std library) C++ and Rust system controllers on a resberry pi pico

---

## 🧩 Overview

Embedded systems form the backbone of modern electronics — from IoT to robotics.
They operate under tight memory and timing constraints, prioritizing reliability and control over raw convenience.
This project develops a stepper motor controller on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2, implemented twice:
•	Once in C++ using the Raspberry Pi SDK.
•	Once in Rust using the rp-hal embedded hardware abstraction library.

## 🎯 Objectives / Learning Goals

- 🔹 [Goal 1] — Understand bare-metal programming (no standard library).  
- 🔹 [Goal 2] — Learn GPIO, PWM, and interrupt control at the register level  
- 🔹 [Goal 3] — Compare safety, readability, and performance between Rust and C++
